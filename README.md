# ASCII-BINARY and BINARY -ASCII conversion for PubSub File transformation  


## problem statement:

Design a program called producer.c that reads a text file (file containing ASCII characters) and encodes all
characters as binary by using characters 1 and 0 to represent binary 1 and 0 respectively. Also design a
program called consumer.c that will read your produced binary file and converts the contents of the
binary file into a sequence of ASCII characters.

## Testing and NamingConvension for Project

You are to use the arrangement below to test your solution. As illustrated, the file testout.txt is the
encoded version of the producerTest.txt file. Your consumer program will process the testout.txt file and
will create the file consumerTest.txt.

<-----> producerTest.txt --> producer.c --> testout.txt --> consumer.c --> consumerTest.txt<------>

## Example:

UNIX has a philosophy, it has 25 years of history behind it, and most importantly, it has a clean core. It
strives for something - some kind of beauty. And that&#39;s really what struck me as a programmer. Operating
systems that normal home users are used to, such as DOS and Windows, didn&#39;t have any way of life.
Nobody tried to design Windows - it just grew in random directions without any kind of thought behind it.
[...] I don&#39;t think Microsoft is evil in itself; I just think that they make really crappy operating systems. Linus
